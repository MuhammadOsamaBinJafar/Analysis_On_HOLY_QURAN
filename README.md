# Analysis_On_HOLY_QURAN
The Holy Quran is the central text for 1.5 billion Muslims around the world. It literally means "The Recitation." It is undoubtedly the finest work in Arabic literature and revealed by Allah (God) to His Messenger Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) through angel Gabriel. It was revealed verbally from December 22, 609 (AD) to 632 AD (when Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) died)

The book is divided into 30 parts, 114 Chapters and 6,000+ verses.

There has been a lot of questions and comments on the text of this holy book given the contemporary Geo-political situation of the world, wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan and the ongoing terrorism.

I have put this dataset together to call my fellow data scientists to run their NLP algorithms and Kernels to find and explore the sacred text by them selves.

The data contains complete Holy Quran in following 21 languages (so data scientists from different parts of the world can work with it)
